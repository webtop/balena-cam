Live stream your balena device's camera feed.

## Getting started

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://balena.io/) and follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started).
- Clone this repository to your local workspace.
- Unset (delete) the environment variable `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` or `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` if exists, from the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab.
- Set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab
  - `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` = `1`
  - Set all the following `gpu_mem` variables so your Pi can autoselect how much memory to allocate for hardware accelerated graphics, based on how much RAM it has available

    | Key                                  | Value
    |--------------------------------------|----------
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_256`**  | **`192`**
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_512`**  | **`256`**
    |**`BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem_1024`** | **`448`**
- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <application-name>`.
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!
- In order for your device to be accessible over the internet, toggle the switch called `PUBLIC DEVICE URL`.
- Once your device finishes updating, you can watch the live feed by visiting your device's public URL.

### Password Protect your balenaCam device

To protect your balenaCam devices using a username and a password set the following environment variables.

| Key            | Value
|----------------|---------------------------
|**`username`**  | **`yourUserNameGoesHere`**
|**`password`**  | **`yourPasswordGoesHere`**

ðŸ’¡ **Tips:** ðŸ’¡ 
* You can set them as [fleet environment variables](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/#fleet-environment-and-service-variables) and every new balenaCam device you add will be password protected.
* You can set them as [device environment variables](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/#device-environment-and-service-variables) and the username and password will be different on each device.

### Optional Settings

- To rotate the camera feed by 180 degrees, add a **device variable**: `rotation` = `1` (More information about this on the [docs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/)).
- To suppress any warnings, add a **device variable**: `PYTHONWARNINGS` = `ignore`

### TURN server configuration


If you have access to a TURN server and you want your balenaCam devices to use it. You can easily configure it using the following environment variables. When you set them all the app will use that TURN server as a fallback mechanism when a direct WebRTC connection is not possible.

| Key            | Value
|----------------|---------------------------
|**`STUN_SERVER`**  | **`stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`**
|**`TURN_SERVER`**  | **`turn:<yourTURNserverIP>:<yourTURNserverPORT>`**
|**`TURN_USERNAME`**  | **`<yourTURNserverUsername>`**
|**`TURN_PASSWORD`**  | **`yourTURNserverPassword`**

## Additional Information

- This project uses [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (a Real-Time Communication protocol).
- A direct WebRTC connection fails in some cases.
- This current version uses mjpeg streaming when the webRTC connection fails.
- Chrome browsers will hide the local IP address from WebRTC, making the page appear but no camera view. To resolve this try the following
  - Enter this URL in your browser: chrome://flags
  - Ensure the media flag is enabled (this will give you access to other features)
  - Now set "Anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC" to Disabled
  - Refresh your app page

## Supported Browsers

- **Chrome**
- **Firefox**
- **Safari**
- **Edge** (only mjpeg stream)
